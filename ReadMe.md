## So why make a GitHub?
#### It's high time I became more serious about CS, especially now that I've begun job
#### * hunting in earnest.  Here I hope to mostly showcase what I'm capable of coding,
#### * especially to capture the interest of employers, but also share a little about
#### * the guy behind the keyboard.
